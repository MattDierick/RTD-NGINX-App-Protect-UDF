Step 4 - Update the Docker image with the latest WAF signatures
###############################################################

In this module, we will update the signature package in the Docker image.

.. warning:: There are several ways to update the signatures. All of them have pros and cons. In this lab, I decided to create a new Docker image with the new signature package to preserve immutability. And then destroy and run a new Docker container from this new image in front of Arcadia App.

The signatures are provided by F5 with an RPM package. The best way to update the image is to build a new image from a new Dockerfile referring to this signature package (and change the image tag). We will use the Dockerfile below:

.. code-block:: bash

   #For CentOS 7
   FROM centos:7.4.1708

   # Download certificate and key from the customer portal (https://cs.nginx.com)
   # and copy to the build context
   COPY nginx-repo.crt nginx-repo.key /etc/ssl/nginx/

   # Install prerequisite packages
   RUN yum -y install wget ca-certificates epel-release

   # Add NGINX Plus repo to yum
   RUN wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d https://cs.nginx.com/static/files/nginx-plus-7.repo
   RUN wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d https://cs.nginx.com/static/files/app-protect-signatures-7.repo

   # Install NGINX App Protect
   RUN yum -y install app-protect app-protect-attack-signatures\
      && yum clean all \
      && rm -rf /var/cache/yum \
      && rm -rf /etc/ssl/nginx

   # Forward request logs to Docker log collector
   #RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log \
   #    && ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log

   # Copy configuration files
   COPY nginx.conf log-default.json /etc/nginx/
   COPY entrypoint.sh  ./

   CMD ["sh", "/entrypoint.sh"]


.. note:: You may notice one more package versus the previous Dockerfile in Step 3. I added the package installation ``app-protect-attack-signatures``


**Follow the steps below to build the new Docker image:**

   #. SSH to Docker App Protect + Docker repo VM
   #. Run the command ``docker build -t app-protect:20200316 -f Dockerfile-sig .`` <-- Be careful, there is a "." (dot) at the end of the command
   #. Wait until you see the message: ``Successfully tagged app-protect:20200316``

.. note:: Please take time to understand what we ran. You may notice 2 changes. We ran the build with a new Dockerfile ``Dockerfile-sig`` and with a new tag ``20200316`` (date of the signature package when I built this lab). You can put any tag you want, for instance the date of today. Because we don't know the date of the latest Attack Signature package.


**Destroy the previous running NAP container and run a new one based on the new image (tag 20200316)**

   1. Check if the new app-protect Docker image is available locally by running ``docker images``. You will notice the new image with a tag of ``20200316``.

      .. image:: ../pictures/module2/docker_images.png
         :align: center

|

   2. Destroy the existing and running NAP container ``docker rm -f app-protect``
   3. Run a new container with this image ``docker run -dit --name app-protect -p 80:80 -v /home/ubuntu/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf app-protect:20200316``

      .. warning :: If you decided to change the tag ``20200316`` by another tag, change your command line accordingly

   4. Check that the Docker container is running ``docker ps``

      .. image:: ../pictures/module2/docker_run.png
         :align: center

|

   5. Check the signature package date included in the new Docker container ``docker exec -it app-protect more /var/log/nginx/error.log``


   .. code-block:: bash
      
      2020/05/20 09:30:20 [notice] 12#12: APP_PROTECT { "event": "configuration_load_success", "attack_signatures_package":{"revision_datetime":"2020-03-16T14:11:52Z","version":"2020.03.16"},"completed_successfully":true}

.. note:: Congrats, you are running a new version of NAP with an updated signature package.

**Video of this module (force HD 1080p in the video settings)**

.. note :: You can notice some differences between the video and the lab. When I did the video, the dockerfile was different. But the concept remains the same.
