Step 15 - A.WAF/ASM Policy Converter
####################################

What is the Policy Converter tool ?
***********************************

NGINX App Protect includes a number of tools that can be used to facilitate the process of porting existing resources or configuration files from the BIG-IP for use in the NGINX App Protect environment. 
Note that these tools are available in the compiler package, and do not require a full installation of NGINX App Protect or NGINX Plus.

.. note :: The goal here is to converter an XML policy for Sharepoint 2016 exported from an A.WAF to a Declarative NAP policy


Steps for the lab
*****************

First of all, the ``Sharepoint 2016 XML policy`` from A.WAF is already imported in the ``Docker App Protect + Docker repo`` machine.

This converter tool is not a bash or shell utility. It a docker image we will run with the XML policy as ``input`` and JSON policy as ``output``.

**Steps**

#. SSH or WebSSH to ``Docker App Protect + Docker repo`` machine
#. Go to directory ``/home/ubuntu/awaf-policy``

    .. code-block:: bash

      cd /home/ubuntu/awaf-policy

#. You can see the ``sharepoint-awaf.xml`` policy file from A.WAF.
#. Now, execute de Docker run command to convert this XML policy to JSON Declarative policy

    .. code-block:: bash

      docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/awaf-policy/:/tmp/convert policy-converter:latest /opt/app_protect/bin/convert-policy -i /tmp/convert/sharepoint-awaf.xml -o /tmp/convert/sharepoint-nap.json | jq

    .. note:: Look at the command. You can notice the ``input`` and the ``output``

#. After few second, you can see the results. In YELLOW, the converter confirms what has been converted and what has NOT been converted (because not supported by NAP)

    .. code-block:: js

    .. code-block:: bash

      more sharepoint-nap.json

.. note:: Congratulations, you converted an XML ASM/AWAF policy to a Declarative NAP policy. You can assign this JSON policy to a NAP configuration.
