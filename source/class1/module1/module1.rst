Architecture of Arcadia Application
###################################

.. note:: This application is available in GitLab in case you want to build your own lab : 

First of all, it is important to understand how Arcadia app is split between micro-services


**This is what Arcadia App looks like when the 4 microservices are up and running, and you can see how traffic is routed based on URI**
