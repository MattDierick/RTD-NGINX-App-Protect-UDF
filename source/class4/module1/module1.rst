Step 11 - Deploy a new version of the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller
###################################################################

As a reminder, in ``Class 1 - Step 2 - Publish Arcadia App with a NGINX Plus Ingress Controller`` we deployed a NGINX Plus instance as an Ingress Controller in our Kubernetes cluster.

.. image:: ../pictures/module3/NAP_index.png
   :align: center

Now, with NAP v1.3, we can deploy this NGINX Plus instance with the NAP module enabled. 

.. image:: ../pictures/module3/nap_kic.png
   :align: center

To do so, we will:

#. Deploy a new version of the Pod (NGINX r22 + NAP v1.3)
#. Deploy a new Ingress configuration template (with NAP configuration files)

.. warning:: The NGINX Plus Ingress Controller image is available on my private Gitlab repo. Don't share the key.

**Steps**

    #. SSH (or WebSSH and ``cd /home/ubuntu/``) to CICD Server
    #. Run this command in order to delete the previous KIC ``kubectl delete -f /home/ubuntu/k8s_ingress/full_ingress_arcadia.yaml``
    #. Run this command in order to push the new version of the KIC ``kubectl apply -f /home/ubuntu/k8s_ingress/full_ingress_arcadia_nap.yaml``
    #. Check the Ingress ``arcadia-ingress`` (in the ``default`` namespace) by clicking on the 3 dots on the right and ``edit``
    #. Scroll down and check the specs

.. image:: ../pictures/module3/arcadia-ingress.png
   :align: center

As you can notice, we added few lines in our Ingress declaration. To do so, I followed the guide (https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/app-protect/installation/)

    #. I added NAP specifications (from the guide)
    #. I added NAP annotations for Arcadia app (see below)

Please a make a new test by clicking on ``Arcadia k8s`` Chrome bookmark.

    #. Open ``Chrome``
    #. Click on ``Arcadia k8s`` bookmark
    #. Now, you are connecting to Arcadia App from a new KIC with NAP enabled
    #. Send an attack (like a XSS in the address bar) by appending ``?a=<script>``
    #. Attack is blocked
    #. Open ELK and check your logs
